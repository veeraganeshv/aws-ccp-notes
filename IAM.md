# IAM: Users and Groups
  - IAM is Identity and Access Management Service. It's a global service.
  - The Root (Main Account) account created is the default account. It should not be shared or used.
  - Create Users and then use them as needed, assign them to groups, and those groups have the necessary permissions.
  - Users are people in the organization and can be grouped. Some users are also not in any group (not a best practice).
  - Users can also belong to multiple groups.
  - Groups only contain users, not other groups.
