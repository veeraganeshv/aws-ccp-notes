# EC2 Instance configured with IAM Roles

- Amazon Linux which is running inside EC2 instance has AWS CLI preinstalled, So you can run all AWS Commands. ex: aws --version, aws configure, aws iam list-users

- Access should not be configured through aws configure command, as it will cause a security issue. Some other user can connect to same instance through ec2 instance connect and run the same command and take the access and secret keys, and use them illegally.

- IAM Roles are assigned to a User/IAM user like wise, we can assign/add an IAM role to an EC2 Instance.
- IAM Roles are attached with permission policies that give access to AWS services and settings. ex: IAMUserList -> to view the list of IAM Users
- IAM Roles can also be connected to an EC2 instance based on the use case/requirements of the EC2 instance. ex: EC2 instance that needs to read a list of IAM Users can be assigned the role "IAMReadUsers", which has the permission policy   "IAMReadAccess".
- Permission policies are available in AWS IAM permissions, and Roles can be created and assigned with any number of permission policies.
