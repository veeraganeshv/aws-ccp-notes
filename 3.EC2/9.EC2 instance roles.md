- IAM Roles are assigned to a User/IAM user like wise, we can assign/add an IAM role to an EC2 Instance.
- IAM Roles are attached with permission policies that give access to AWS services and settings. ex: IAMUserList -> to view the list of IAM Users
- IAM Roles can also be connected to an EC2 instance based on the use case/requirements of the EC2 instance. ex: EC2 instance that needs to read a list of IAM Users can be assigned the role "IAMReadUsers", which has the permission policy   "IAMReadAccess".
- Permission policies are available in AWS IAM permissions, and Roles can be created and assigned with any number of permission policies.
