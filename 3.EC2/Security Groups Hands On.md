# Security Groups Hands-On working
  - The security tab for an instance is available in the instance details, and we can refer to the security rules and its details of that instance. It contains inbound and outbound rules of that instance.

  - The Security group button available from the side menu shows the full list of security groups available for all the instances. We can select groups and view security group rules associated with that group.
