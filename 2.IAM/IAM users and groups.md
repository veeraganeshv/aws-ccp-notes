# IAM Users and Groups
  - IAM is a global service (it is all over the world and not region-specific)
  - From search, go to IAM, refer side menu and go to Users
  - Create a User by giving details, and Create a group with the correct access level, like adminAccess.
  - Review all the details like user details, add a group, and create the user.
  - Now, a New User is created with the correct access level

    Ex: User: Grace, Group: Admin

    User Grace has admin-level access.
