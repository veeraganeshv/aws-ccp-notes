- IAM Credentials Reports give you data on users and their activity over the account.
- It contains details like password last used, MFA active or not, and much more.
- Can download the security report and analyse the data.
- The last access option under users from the side menu for each user is used to check the user's latest activity over the services used and permissions used.
- By this, the admin can modify the permissions and roles of a user which is allowed to do so.
