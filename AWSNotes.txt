Traditional IT Overview
  - Server On-premises or bought from vendor
  - Client -> Internet -> Server(software hosted)
  - File System (data storage)
  - Databases
  -API
What is Cloud Computing
  - On-demand Delivery of compute power, DB, apps, and other it resources.
  - Cloud service platforms provide us pay as you go pricing.
  - We can procure exact size and type of compute based on our requirement.
  - We can scale it instantly without hassle.
  - Simple way to access server, DBs, storage, and other application services.
EX: AWS owns and maintains these hardware and connected software services, that we can purchase and use the required services based on our need through their AWS web application (AWS CONSOLE UI).

An application that stores files and photos. It uses AWS storage services and an application is built on top of it for file storage. then it's a cloud application/service.
Some cloud apps/services are Gmail, Dropbox, Mega, Netflix, Spotify. These services use any cloud computing services like AWS, AZURE, GCP and build their cloud services.

ex: Netflix mainly uses AWS for their on-demand video streaming.
    Google Photos uses GCP storage services

Types
  - Private Cloud (Personal server space provided by server company) ex: Rackspace, Digital ocean, etc.
  - Public Cloud (AWS, GCP, AZURE)
  - Hybrid Cloud (Combination of private and public) where sensitive data is stored in on-premise setup whereas other data is processed/stored in cloud computing services.
Each Cloud services provide services for different use cases
AWS, AZURE, GCP
5 Characteristics of Cloud Computing
  - On-Demand
  - Broad Networking
  - Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
  - Rapid Elasticity and Scalability
  - Measured Service -> Uage is measured, So Pay for only what you use
Advantages of Cloud Computing
  - Don't Own Hardware, pay for what you use (CAPEX for OPEX), Reduce total cost of ownership
  - Massive adoption of cloud computing will decrease the price
  - Scale based on actual usage
  - speed and agility due to on-demand availability
  - No hassle of maintaining own data centres
  - easy subscription and a fast way to get the application online
Problems Solved by Cloud Computing
  - Flexibility
  - Scalability
  - Cost Effectiveness
