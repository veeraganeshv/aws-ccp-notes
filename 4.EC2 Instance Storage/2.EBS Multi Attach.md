# EBS Multi Attach

EBS volumes cannot be attached to multiple instances, It is not true for io1 and io2 volume types: this is called the EBS Multi-Attach feature.

From an AWS Cloud Practitioner exam perspective this out of scope for the exam.

For self learning about EBS Multi Attach, [EBS AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volumes-multi.html).
